                <p>A few weeks ago, we launched a promotion of <span class="highlight">50% off for 6 months</span> for those who subscribe 15 days or less after signing up for a myAbakus account.</p>
                <p>It is an incentive we are giving to those interested in having clear and up to date accounts for their businesses with the help of myAbakus.</p>
                <p>Initially the promotion was valid only for new accounts, leaving out all those who had signed up for a myAbakus account in the past.</p>
                <p>That did not seem fair so today we are offering the same discount to all those who have a myAbakus  account but did not continue using it.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in taking advantage of this offer, all you have to do is <a href="https://www.myabakus.com/en/login">log into your account</a> to reset the trial period or if your prefer, you can also <a href="http://www.myabakus.com">create a new account</a>.</p>
                <p>And if you have questions, concerns or need help getting started, please contact us using the chat window within the application.</p>
